        Finding a pet can be a difficult task.  Also, there is finding all the tools and foods to keep them happy and healthy.  The site is here to help you find the animal shelter keeping your future family member.   

        Also, many of the pets from shelters and rescues are already house-trained, which means youre not only saving a pets life, but you may also be saving your rug. Adopting a mature pet not only gives older animals a second chance, but it also often means introducing them to your family will be much easier.

        Each year, it's estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.
        The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopt pets instead of buying them. When you adopt dogs and cats, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.

        Not only do animals give you unconditional love, but they have been shown to be psychologically, emotionally and physically beneficial to their companions. Caring for a pet can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment and lessen feelings of loneliness. And when you adopt, you can also feel proud about helping an animal in need!

      <h3>Cats</h3>
      <p>
        Decide whether you want a kitten or an adult cat.  Like puppies, kittens can be a lot of work.  While most kittens learn how to use a litterbox without too much trouble, they require serious supervision and patience.  Kittens will get into everything they can get their paws on.  You need to keep a close eye on them to keep them safe. Also, its important to know that a kittens personality can change a lot as he grows up.  When you adopt an adult cat, there usually arent any surprises.  A cuddly, playful adult cat will probably stay that way.

      </ul>
      <h3>Dogs</h3>
      <p>
        Be realistic about your lifestyle and energy level. If youre a couch potato, dont adopt a dog who needs lots of exercise. Adopt a dog with the same or lower energy level as you. And if you work long hours or travel frequently, dont adopt a puppy. They need lots of training and attention. Adopt a laid-back guy instead.
        Who else lives in your home? Do you have young children or other pets? Its important to adopt a dog that will fit in safely and happily with all the members of your household. If youre new to dog parenthood, have small children at home, and a demanding job, getting a high-maintenance dog might not be a good idea. You would probably do better with a chill, older dog who doesnt need to be trained.
