            <p>Finding a pet can be a difficult task.  Also, there is finding all the tools and foods to keep them happy and healthy.  The site is here to help you find the animal shelter keeping your future family member.   

                Also, many of the pets from shelters and rescues are already house-trained, which means you’re not only saving a pet’s life, but you may also be saving your rug. Adopting a mature pet not only gives older animals a second chance, but it also often means introducing them to your family will be much easier.
                
                Each year, it's estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.
                The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopt pets instead of buying them. When you adopt dogs and cats, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.
                
                Not only do animals give you unconditional love, but they have been shown to be psychologically, emotionally and physically beneficial to their companions. Caring for a pet can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment and lessen feelings of loneliness. And when you adopt, you can also feel proud about helping an animal in need!
